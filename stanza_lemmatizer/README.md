## Stanza lemmatizer with MedLexSp forms and lemmas of medical terms

The lemmatizer model is an updated version of the Ancora default model for Spanish with medical lemmas and forms from the MedLexSp lexicon (new 104 551 forms).

Place the model file ``ancora-medlexsp.pt`` in the folder with the Spanish Stanza models. 

Generally, it is found in: ``/home/stanza_resources/es/lemma/ancora.pt``

Rename the new model file, or update the path with the new file name (``ancora.pt`` &rarr; ``ancora-medlexsp.pt``)
